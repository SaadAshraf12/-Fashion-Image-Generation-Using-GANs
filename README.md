# Fashion-Image-Generation-Using-GANs

This project utilizes a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate realistic fashion images. By training on a dataset of clothing items, the model learns to synthesize high-quality images that mimic real-world apparel.

The architecture consists of a generator and a discriminator, both built using deep convolutional layers. The generator progressively refines its outputs, while the discriminator distinguishes between real and generated images. The training process involves adversarial learning, where the generator improves by trying to fool the discriminator.

Techniques such as batch normalization, ReLU activations in the generator, and LeakyReLU in the discriminator are employed for stable training. The model is evaluated based on generated image quality and loss function convergence. This GAN-based approach has potential applications in fashion design, virtual try-ons, and AI-assisted apparel creation.
